## Finite Difference Method

* Incompact3d: Incompact3d is a Fortran-MPI based, finite difference high-performance code for solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation and as many as you need scalar transport equations. ([Fortran](https://github.com/xcompact3d/Incompact3d))
* Python package for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). The package provides classes for grids on which scalar and tensor fields can be defined. ([Python](https://github.com/zwicker-group/py-pde))
