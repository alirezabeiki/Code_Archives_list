# Grid Generation and Adaptive Mesh Refinment

[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com)


## Some Repositories
* N-dimensional adaptive mesh refinment tree structure in Python. ([Python](https://github.com/adamdempsey90/NDTAMR))
* Two-dimensional, high-order, cut cell mesh generator. Simple code to generate embedded boundary grids, where the boundary is a piecewise-defined polynomial that interpolates the nonlinear boundary. ([Python](https://github.com/andrewgiuliani/PyGrid2D))
